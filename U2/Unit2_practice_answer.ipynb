The checker should asses the 'entry' variable (that will be provided), and compare it to the 'password' variable that holds the true password. If the passwords match, the program should print \"Permission Granted\", or something to that effect. If the passwords do not match, it should print \"Ah, ah, ah, didn't say the Magic Word\". Make sure to test both possible conditions."
