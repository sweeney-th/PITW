    "I would not be suprised to find that something seemed to be missing in the last lesson. If you felt that way, fear not, because it's here: the else statment. The else statement allows us to complement the 'if' statement in a sensible way, answering the implied question of \"if not, then what?' asked in the last post. The 'else' statement serves to answer the negative conditon of the 'if', and works the same way syntatically:"
