    "I've mentioned data types a few time so far. We've encountered strings, and have been working with numbers. For reasons of efficient memory use, computers make some distinctions when working with numbers however, so we need to a little more specific. You may recall that I said an \"int\" is a number with no decimal place. Int stands for integer. If a number DOES have a decimal, it is called a \"float\", for \"floating point number\". They take up a little more room in memory.\n",
