    "We introduced compound logic the last lesson when we paired a 'for' and an 'if'. It's worth noting you can use compound or 'nested' logic like this with two if's as well. I am showing it here because there was already 'else' and 'elif' to worry about and achieve flexibility when we were learning 'if'. It also fits nicely into a real world context here. Here is an example of two 'if's. "
