    "Now that we have stored our data in a structure, we can proceed to use it as we see fit. If we still have to access each element with a variable one at a time, however, there wasn't that much point in storing it that way to begin with. This is where iteration comes in. Iteration is a simple but important concept in computer programming. Iteration is the repetition of a process systematically. In the context of a data structure, it just means we do something to each element of the structure. This is usually called \"iterating over\" or \"iterating through\" the lists, acting on each element in turn. The syntactic construct most commonly associated with iteration is the \"for\" loop, and it uses the same syntax as the \"if\" keyword, but adds and intuitive 'in' to the mix. "
