    "1) Let's say we want to make a prototype program that checks if a user entered a valid ID number. The ID numbers in our hypothetical system are supposed to be 8 characters long. Write a program that uses the if-elif-else idiom to determine if the length of a string is too short, too long, and just right. Print specific feedback to the user that tells them which problem they have, if any, and confirms their entry if they have the right length. This requires some elements of previous units.  "
