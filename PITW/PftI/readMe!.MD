Hello! Welcome to 'Perl for the Impatient'!. This is designed to serve as
a preposterously brief and somehow practical guide to getting things done
with Perl. It works as a quick overview or refresher, so if you're curious
about the language or just inherited a freaky webscraper from that strange
dude whose about to retired, step right up.

I wrote it to be read in the following order, but if something strikes your
fancy, it should be more or less sensible to pick it up by topic if you've
got a little familiarity.

startHere.pl
typesAndPrinting.pl
usingArrays.pl
usingHashes.pl
logicAndControlFlow.pl
subroutines.pl
regex.pl

if you think this is all well and good, but might teach you Just Enough To Be
Dangerous, you're right! Anything could happen! In all seriousness, though,
this isn't comprehensive.

Consider the below my sources cited and my further reading list:
